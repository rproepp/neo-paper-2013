Here are the rules used when redesigning base_schematic2.svg:

1) Colours:

- As much as possible, use one colour per Neo object (not very easy for 
  individual spikes...)

- Use the following shades of colours:
 - black for Block
 - shades of grey for segments
 - shades of blue for objects related to analog signals
 - shades of red-orange-brown for objects related to spikes
 - shades of purple for objects related to epochs
 - shades of green for objects related to events
 - pink for RecordingChannelGroup
 
2) Symbolisation:

- Symbolise all the Neo core objects

- Inside a grouping object (= Unit, RecordingChannel, RecordingChannelGroup) or 
  inside a container object (= Block, Segment) draw at least one item of each 
  class that can be contained by the object 

- Use doted lines to symbolise arrays

- Use rectangles to symbolise container objects

- Use cartouches to symbolise grouping objects 

3) Text:

- Use the same font (DejaVu Sans), with the same font size (16) for all the 
  text

- The font colour of a text matches the colour of the corresponding object
